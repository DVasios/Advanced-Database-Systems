# Advanced Database Systems 2023
Electrical & Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens
## Description
In this assessment, we  analyze and benchmark a set of queries utilizing Big Data processing techniques in a distributed cluster. The experimental environment consists of a cluster comprising two nodes with resources that are provided by the university. The utilization of Apache Hadoop and Spark facilitates the parallel processing of a large dataset.  Apache Hadoop, an industry-standard framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets, serves as a fundamental component of our tool set, along with Spark which serves as our main engine to run the queries in the distributed file system. The main objective of this assessment is to get familiar with these tools and architectures, to use modern techniques through Spark APIs to analyze volume data and understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools in relation to the available resources and the settings chosen.
